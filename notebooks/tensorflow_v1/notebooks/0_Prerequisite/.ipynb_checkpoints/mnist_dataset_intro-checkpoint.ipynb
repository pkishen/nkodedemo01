    "# MNIST Dataset Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Most examples are using MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset contains 60,000 examples for training and 10,000 examples for testing. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image (28x28 pixels) with values from 0 to 1. For simplicity, each image has been flatten and converted to a 1-D numpy array of 784 features (28*28).\n",
